One of the biggest hurdles in submitting a thesis or dissertation is getting the formatting right — the rules are arcane, and the registrar is pedantic. Few students have the background needed to design and typeset clean and stylish documents. Enter Dissertate. Dissertate is a set of beautiful Word and LaTeX templates for a thesis or dissertation. To date, the software provides everything needed to support the production and typesetting of a PhD dissertation at Harvard, Princeton, and NYU, though it will be adapted to meet the requirements of other schools — eventually all of them. The format and styling are based closely on the requirements published by each university's registrar. Eventually, Dissertate can provide a web app that automatically arranges for the document to be printed and mailed to the student. This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/dissertate](https://assembly.com/dissertate).
